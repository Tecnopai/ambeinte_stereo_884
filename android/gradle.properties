## If you have JDK 21 installed, point Gradle to it so builds use Java 21.
## Update the path below to match your JDK 21 installation. Example paths:
## - Windows: C:/Program Files/Java/jdk-21
## - User-local: C:/Users/<you>/jdk-21
## The line below was an example and caused Gradle to fail on this machine
## because the path didn't exist. Commenting it out so Gradle can use
## the system JAVA_HOME instead. If you prefer to hard-code the JDK path,
## update the line below to the real path and remove the leading '#'.
# org.gradle.java.home=C:/Program Files/Java/jdk-21

## Recommended: set your system JAVA_HOME to the JDK 21 installation path
## and ensure its bin is on PATH. Then Gradle will pick it up automatically.
